### Who the hell are you people????

We're a team o-

### Cut it with the official tone!

Two dudes making games

### FINALLY, what did you do?

We made [9 games](https://sparrowworks.itch.io/) and uh... [open sourced](https://github.com/Sparrowworks) them along with a bunch of systems we used to make them...

### See how efficient this is?

Tell that to [Sparrow](https://github.com/SP4R0W) not me, i am [Varga](https://github.com/VargaDot)

### Why is his name "SP4R0W"

Idk i guess it's a quirk of some sort

### And why's your name Varga, are you like hungarian or something

No, why you keep asking these questions?

### So is that it? you made 9 dumb clones and hosted them and i'm supposed to be impressed?

OH WELL YOU GO AND MAKE THEM SINCE YOU'RE SO SMART! PLEASE, SHOW US YOUR TALENTS

### Dude, you literally just copy-pasted some jekyll theme and called it a website

Well i don't wanna spend months creating it from scratch

### Well that's because you are lazy and should work hard

So you think working hard means spending 8 months recreating something that's already been done because... what?

### Well because if you don't then your productivity rate will be very low

Skip to **0:07** {% include embed/{youtube}.html id='{BNUijL9260g}' %}

### Look who discovered embeds, maybe you'll get to rank up from breastfeeding to the milk bottle

Who the hell are YOU anyway

### I am the toxic YOU, the figment of imagination you've created because you HAVE no audience or coverage

Then i must become you to beat you!

### Good luck on that! HAHAHAHAHA

## Toxic me don't be toxic!

### No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

## Toxic me don't be toxic!

#### NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

## Toxic me don't be toxic!

##### nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

## Hehe
