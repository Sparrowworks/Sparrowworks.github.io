## Who the hell are you people?

We're two guys, [Sparrow](https://github.com/SP4R0W) and [Varga](https://github.com/VargaDot) and we originally started making games as a portfolio thingy, unfortunately however C;VID and C&pital had other plans killed that "vision" very quickly...

## Did you create anything?

We've made [9 games](https://sparrowworks.itch.io/) so far with [Infamy](https://sparrowworks.itch.io/infamy) being a "real IP" the rest are learning projects more or less.

They're all [open-source](https://github.com/Sparrowworks) along with systems we used to create them! like our scene management system [Composer](https://github.com/Sparrowworks/ComposerGodot) and our weapon system [Vanguard](https://github.com/Sparrowworks/Vanguard)!

## So, what do you guys wanna achieve in life?

Become an established [Video Game Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher).

## What tools do you use?

1. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - Game engine
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - To keep track of changes to code
3. [Github](https://github.com/) - For hosting code and coordinating work.
4. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - To host this website
5. [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) / [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - To upload & download code to & from github and locally
6. [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) - Pixel art
7. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) - Sound stuff
